### Games

PTN Ninja can store multiple games to allow easy switching between them via the Game Selector. Loaded games are stored in the browser until closed from the Game Selector. You're responsible for closing games you no longer need. You can automatically close or download all games by **clicking** the game count.

You can load games from **.ptn** or **.txt** files, or from URLs originating from [PlayTak](https://www.playtak.com/games) or PTN Ninja itself.

- To create a new game, **click** the **+** button in the main menu to open the New Game dialog.
- To load an existing game, **click** the **+** button in the main menu, then select the Load Game tab.
- Or, **drag** one or more **.ptn** or **.txt** files into the window.
- Use the Game Selector in the top toolbar, or hotkeys, to switch between games.
- **Swipe left** or **right-click** the Floating Action Button to switch to the previous game.

When opening via URL a game with the same name as an already open game, the new game will be opened under a unique name (by means of an incrementing number at the end). If you prefer to instead replace the open game, this option ("Replace") can be found in the UI section of the Preferences dialog under "Duplicate Game Names." Replacing a game will preserve the undo history of the existing game, so the replacement can be undone.

### Playback

- Navigate the game using the **Play Controls** or <kbd>◀/▶</kbd>.
- **Right-click** the Back or Forward button to move by a **half-step** or use <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>◀/▶</kbd>.
- **Drag** or **click** the scrub bar to quickly jump to a different point in the game.

### Place a Stone

- **Click** on a square to place a flat stone.
- **Click** the square again to cycle the stone type.
- Or, **right-click** the square to cycle in the reverse order.

### Move a Piece or Stack

- **Click** a square to select the whole stack.
- Or, **right-click** a square to select pieces from the **top** of the stack.
- Then, **click** further squares to drop pieces.
- Or, **right-click** a square to pick up dropped pieces, or drop the selected stack if there are none.
- **Click** the initial square to cancel the move.

Branches

PTN Ninja records multiple lines of play, called "branches." Branches outside the current line of play are hidden by default. You can display branches by **clicking** the Branch button in the PTN toolbar.

- Use <kbd>▲/▼</kbd> <span>or</span> <kbd>0-9</kbd> to navigate between branches.
- **Right-click** a branch title to **rename** or **delete** it.

PTN

[PTN](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tak/wiki/portable_tak_notation) is the notation that describes the moves of the game. The full PTN is hidden by default. To show it, you can click the leftmost button in the header toolbar.
